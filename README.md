# Simulated Annealing for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## Description
This project implements a **simulated annealing algorithm** to optimize delivery truck routes, with the primary objective of minimizing the total travel distance. The focus is on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) while adhering to truck capacity constraints.

---

## Objective
The primary objective is to determine the optimal routes for a fleet of trucks that:
1. Minimize the total travel distance.
2. Ensure delivery locations are serviced while adhering to truck capacity constraints.

## Features
- **Simulated Annealing Algorithm**: Uses a cooling schedule to iteratively refine solutions.
- **Customizable Problem Definition**: Allows for defining delivery points, demands, and truck capacities.
- **Neighborhood Search**: Generates neighboring solutions by swapping delivery points between routes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
